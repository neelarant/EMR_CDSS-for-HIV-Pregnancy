                                <p></p>
                                Option B+
                                <p></p>
                                Recommended by the WHO for generalized epidemics, where CD4 count testing and partner testing is limited and where breastfeeding duration is long and fertility is high.
                                <p></p>

                                TDF + 3TC (or FTC) + EFV for life
                                <p></p>
                                The updated NIH guidelines of 2014 recommend EFV only after 8 weeks of pregnancy secondary to teratogenicity concerns, unless a woman presents for care already on EFV and the regimen is effective and well tolerated(Panel on Treatment of HIV Infected Pregnant Women and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission, 2014).
                                <p></p>
                                NASCOP/Kenyan Ministry of Health Recommendations for ARV during pregnancy<p></p>
                                All HIV infected pregnant women should be counselled on comprehensive HIV care including use of ARVs for their own health and for PMTCT <br></br>
                                All HIV-infected pregnant women should have their HIV disease staged using WHO clinical staging and Immunological staging (CD4 count) <br></br>
                                The women should also be screened and treated for opportunistic infections including TB <br></br>
                                All HIV-infected pregnant women should have baseline laboratory and other necessary diagnostic evaluations including Hb, rhesus blood group and ABO typing, VDRL, urine analysis and STI screening<br></br>
                                ALT and creatinine levels for women eligible for HAART<br></br>
                                OI prophylaxis and micronutrient supplementation: multivitamins and co-trimoxazole (CTX)- one double strength or two single strength tablets once daily for all PLHIV (sulphur-based intermittent presumptive malaria treatment should not be given to women who are on CTX prophylaxis)<p></p>
                                ARV use:<p></p>
                                ARVs for treatment and for PMTCT<br></br>
                                HIV-infected pregnant women eligible for ART should initiate ART as soon as possible after adherence counselling. Eligibility is determined as CD4 less than or equal to 350cells/mm^3 at any WHO clinical stage or at WHO clinical stage 3 and 4 irrespective of CD4 count.<br></br>
                                HIV-infected pregnant women already on ART before becoming pregnant should continue ART. Regimen substitution may be necessary in some cases. Evaluation for treatment response/failure should be done as soon as feasible.<p></p>

                                ARVs for prophylaxis (PMTCT)<br></br>
                                Mothers who are not eligible for ART should be started on ARV prophylaxis. They should be initiated at 14 weeks of pregnancy or as soon as possible thereafter. <br></br>
                                In setting with the capacity to initiate and monitor triple therapy on HIV infected pregnant women, triple ARV prophylaxis can be used- Option B and Option B+ (continued for life without interruption) <p></p>

                                NASCOP/Kenyan Ministry of Health Recommendations for Option B+	<p></p>

                                The recommended maternal triple ARV regimens for option B plus include <p></p>

                                TDF+3TC+EFV (WHO recommendation), <p></p>
                                <p></p>
                                AZT+3TC+EFV,
                                <p></p>
                                AZT+3TC+LPV/r- with Nevirapine exposure within 12 months,
                                <p></p>
                                AZT+3TC+ABC.
                                <p></p>
                                Nevirapine based regimens are not recommended because of the risk of hepatotoxicity for women with high CD4 counts(>250 cells/mm^3). NASCOP as of 2012 does not recommend first trimester administration of EFV.
                                <p></p>
                                AZT is contraindicated in women with a haemoglobin level of 8 or below.
                                <p></p>
                                NASCOP continues to recommend WHO staging and CD4 count testing to monitor progress (Republic of Kenya Ministry of Health, 2012).
                                <p></p>
                                Option B
                                <p></p>

                                Consideration can be given to stopping the ARV drugs in women not eligible for ART after the period of mother-to-child transmission risk has ended.(World Health Organization, 2013).”
                                <p></p>

                                Women who receive an NNRTI based ART regimen that is discontinued after delivery should receive a dual-NRTI regimen alone or with a PI for 7-30 days in order to reduce the likelihood of development of a NNRTI resistance (Panel on Treatment of HIV Infected Pregnant Women and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission, 2014).

                                NASCOP continues to recommend Option A in locations not able to adopt Options B and B+. In this case NASCOP recommends:<br></br>
                                AZT (300mg BD) from 14 weeks of pregnancy or as soon as possible thereafter. <br></br>
                                At the onset of labour, give AZT 600mg plus 3TC 300mg plus NVP 200mg at once. <br></br>
                                AZT (300mg BD) and 3TC( 150mgBD) should be given for 7 days post delivery to reduce the risk of NVP resistance development.<p></p>

                                •	If the regimen is well tolerated and effective it should be continued.<br></br>
                                •	EFV should be continued in pregnant women presenting in the first trimester if the current regimen has achieved virologic control.

                                •	Drug resistance testing should be carried out on those with detectable viremia on cART (>500-1000copies/ml).

                                •	A detailed history of all previous ARV usage should be taken including efficacy, tolerance, adherence issues and results of prior resistance testing.
                                <br></br>
                                •	Drug resistance testing should be done for all eligible (viral load > 500-1000 copies/ml). If the woman presents for care late in pregnancy, ART should be initiated prior to the receipt of results.
                                <br></br>
                                •	If the woman previously received ARV for her own health or is not achieving virologic suppression on the current regimen, HIV specialist consultation is recommended.

                                •	If acute HIV infection is suspected during pregnancy, an HIV antibody test should be performed in conjunction with a plasma HIV RNA test.

                                •	All women with acute or recent HIV infection should start an ARV regimen as soon as possible. Because of the high viral load in acute HIV infection, rates of perinatal transmission and transmission from breastfeeding are high.
                                <p></p>

                                •	Genotypic resistance testing should be conducted in conjunction with initiation of ARV drugs. Regimens may be modified but treatment initiation should not be delayed.

                                •	A ritonavir-boosted PI- based regimen is the preferred ARV therapy (Panel on Treatment of HIV Infected Pregnant Women and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission, 2014).

                                radiograph (with abdominal shielding
                                to minimise risk to the foetus). Sputum smear
                                and culture should be
                                performed in individuals suspicious for TB
                                even in the absence of positive
                                finding on chest radiograph. It is possible to
                                have falsely negative sputum
                                smears in individuals with advanced disease
                                and non-cavitary involvement.
                                Nucleic- acid amplification testing can be
                                useful in this situation.<br></br>
                                • Drug susceptibility testing should be
                                conducted on all positive cultures.<br></br>
                                • Obstetrical complications of TB include
                                preterm birth, low birth weight
                                and intrauterine growth restriction.<br></br>
                                • The risk of maternal and neonatal mortality in
                                HIV and TB co-infected
                                pregnant women is high.<br></br>
                                • Congenital TB, though uncommon, has been
                                reported.<br></br>
                                • Preventative treatment of latent tuberculosis
                                during pregnancy should be
                                considered and should include ART, isoniazid
                                and pyridoxine.<br></br>
                                • ART should be initiated in all HIV and TB co-
                                infected persons as well as
                                in all pregnant women.<br></br>
                                • ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of TB
                                treatment for those with CD4
                                count less than 50 cells/mm^3 and within 8-12
                                weeks for all others.<br></br>
                                • Many significant interactions between ARVs
                                and drugs used in the
                                treatment of tuberculosis exist.<br></br> <p></p>

                                Experience with second-line drugs in pregnancy
                                is limited. Therapy for
                                MDR-TB should not be withheld, and should be
                                managed by a specialist. The
                                following should be taken into consideration:<br></br>
                                o Streptomycin use is associated with a 10%
                                rate of eighth nerve toxicity
                                in infants with in utero exposure.<br></br>
                                o 2% of children exposed to long term in utero
                                exposure to kanamycin
                                therapy like streptomycin have documented
                                hearing loss. <br></br>
                                o Theoretical risk for ototoxicity with in utero
                                exposure to amikacin and
                                capreomycin exist but has not been
                                documented, therefore these may be
                                useful alternatives when an aminoglycoside is
                                needed.<br></br>
                                o Quinolones have caused arthropathy in
                                animal studies but studies of use
                                in pregnant humans have failed to show
                                increased rates of arthropathy or
                                birth defects. Fluroquinolones may be used for
                                MDR-TB if use is required
                                based on susceptibility testing.<br></br>
                                o Para-aminosalicyic acid is not teratogenic in
                                rabbits or rats. One study
                                indicates a possible increase in limb and ear
                                abnormalities<br></br>
                                o Ethionamide use during pregnancy is limited.
                                Studies in mice, rats and rabbits have associated high dose exposure with anomalies, but not at
                                doses equivalent to those used in humans-avoid unless necessary<br></br>
                                o Cycloserine lacks data from animal studies and there are no reports of human use (Panel on
                                Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents, 2013)

                                    Various studies cited a

                                    that it be confined to the

                                    trunk, then extremities. The
                                    lesions evolve from macule to papule to

                                    •	Herpes simplex infections can be diagnosed clinically or with viral cultural, HSV DNA PCR and HSV antigen detection.<br></br>
                                    •	The clinical course consists of a sensory prodrome followed by lesional evolution from papule to vesicle, ulcer and crust stages in orolabial herpes. Mucocutaneous manifestations are only visible as ulcers. <br></br>
                                    •	Pregnant women are at increased risk of visceral HSV disease which can be fatal. <br></br>
                                    •	Pregnant women may be offered episodic treatment with Acyclovir 400mg 3 times per day, or, Valacyclovir 1g PO 2 times per day. Treatment duration is 5-10 days for orolabial lesions and 5-14 days for genital lesions. <br></br>
                                    •	HSV-2 transmission risk to the infant is low in recurrent infection. The highest risk of transmission exists in primary infections near delivery. <br></br>
                                    •	Pregnant women with recurrent genital HSV lesions may be offered prophylaxis with Acyclovir 400mg PO 2 times per day, or, Valacyclovir 500mg PO 2 times per day from 36 weeks gestation until delivery. <br></br>
                                    •	Caesarean section is indicated if genital HSV lesions or prodromal symptoms are present at the onset of labour(Panel on Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents, 2013) <br></br>

                                    Trichomoniasis in the HIV+ woman has been
                                    associated with increased vaginal
                                    viral shedding of HIV. For this reason
                                    treatment is recommended for HIV +
                                    women.

                    • In general, immunogenicity is improved in
                    immunocompetent individuals
                    with CD4 greater than 200cells/mm^3.<br></br>
                    • If the vaccine is given at a CD4 count less
                    than 200 cells/mm^3
                    consideration should be given to repeating the
                    vaccination when the CD4
                    count has risen above 200 cells/mm^3.<br></br>
                    • Live, attenuated viral and live bacterial
                    vaccines should be avoided in
                    the immunocompromised patient and are
                    contraindicated in the pregnant
                    patient.<br></br>
                    • No evidence of risk exists to the pregnant
                    woman or foetus with
                    inactivated virus or inactivated bacterial
                    vaccines or toxoids.<br></br>
                    • In all cases likely benefit must outweigh risk.

                                    should be estimated every 2 weeks.
                                    If the 2 weekly FMH is positive, a minimum of
                                    500 i.u should be given (more
                                    if FMH greater than 4 ml) regardless of the
                                    presence or absence of passive
                                    anti-D and FMH should be reevaluated after 72

                                    D type of the neonate. Maternal samples for
                                    confirmatory ABO and D type
                                    and FMH should be collected after 30-45
                                    minutes of the FMH to allow the
                                    foetal blood to disperse adequately in the
                                    maternal circulation. At least
                                    500 i.u should be administered to the

                                    than 4ml. Additional 125 i.u. of anti-D
                                    immune globulin should be
                                    administered for each additional ml of FMH. In
                                    cases of FMH greater than
                                    80 ml, intravenous anti-D administration
                                    should be considered.

                    later and 96 hours after the second dose.<br></br>

                    affordable, feasible,
                    acceptable, sustainable and safe.

                    • If virologic response is appropriate, continue
                    ARV regimen and recommend
                    scheduled caesarean delivery at 38 weeks by
                    best obstetrical dating to
                    reduce likelihood of HIV transmission<br></br>
                    • If caesarean delivery is elected follow routine
                    caesarean delivery
                    management (including prophylactic
                    antibiotics), counsel risks related to
                    surgery, anaesthesia and post partum infection.<br></br>

                    much as possible<br></br>
                    • Administer a 1 hour loading dose of
                    zidovudine and continuous IV
                    zidovudine for 2 hours prior to caesarean
                    delivery (3 hours total)
                    Women on ARVs with viral load greater than

                    labour or after rupture of membranes<br></br>
                    • Begin IV zidovudine administration as above
                    immediately while continuing
                    ARV regimen. If oral zidovudine is part of the
                    ARV regimen, it may be held
                    while IV zidovudine is being administered.<br></br>
                    • Individualise management (vaginal vs.
                    caesarean delivery) based on
                    clinical factors.<br></br>
                    • If caesarean delivery is chosen administration
                    of the IV loading dose of
                    zidovudine should be completed before
                    surgery.<br></br>
                    • Women should be informed of the risks
                    associated with caesarean delivery
                    and if indicated for prevention of perinatal
                    transmission of HIV should be
                    weighed against likely benefit to the infant.
                    <p></p>
                    Women on ARVs with sustained viral load ≤1000 copies/ml<br></br>
                    • Continue ARVs as scheduled.<br></br>
                    • IV zidovudine administration is at the
                    discretion of the treating
                    clinician but appears not to confer additional
                    benefit.<br></br>
                    • Caesarean delivery is not recommended for
                    prevention of perinatal
                    transmission in women on cART with viral load
                    levels consistently ≤ 1000
                    copies/ml.

                    Women on ARVs with undetectable viral load<br></br>
                    • Counsel that perinatal transmission rates are
                    less than 1% with
                    undetectable viral load.<br></br>
                    • Continue ARV administration as scheduled.<br></br>
                    • IV zidovudine administration is at the
                    discretion of the treating
                    clinician but appears not to confer additional
                    benefit.<br></br>
                    • There is no evidence of benefit of caesarean
                    delivery in women receiving
                    cART with an undetectable viral load, and the
                    risks of caesarean delivery
                    likely outweigh the benefits in this population.
                    <p></p>
                    In women who receive a CYP 3A4 enzyme
                    inhibitor such as a PI, methergine
                    should be avoided for the treatment of post
                    partum haemorrhage unless no
                    alternative treatments are available and usage
                    outweighs risk. If used, the
                    lowest effective dose for the shortest possible
                    duration should be
                    administered. The combination of these drugs
                    may result in exaggerated
                    vasoconstriction.

                    Women receiving a CYP 3A4 enzyme inducer
                    such as nevaripine, efavirenz or
                    etravirine, methergine activity will be reduced
                    and alternative
                    uterotonics/ higher doses of methergine may
                    be required.

                    birth and continue for 6 weeks.<br></br>
                    • A 4 week zidovudine regimen may be
                    considered when the infant was ≥ 35

                                    At all points anti- D immune globulin should be administered as soon as possible and within 72 hours of the potentially sensitising event.

                                    In uncomplicated spontaneous abortion anti-D administration is not necessary.
                                    In cases of therapeutic abortion 250 i.u of anti-D immunoglobulin should be administered intramuscularly to known D negative women who are not sensitised to D.<br></br>
                                    Recurrent bleeding that stops prior to confirmed 12 weeks of gestation does not require anti-D immunoglobulin.
                                    <br></br><br></br>
                                    Between 12-20 weeks gestation:<br></br>
                                    250 i.u. intramuscularly should be administered to known D negative women who are not already sensitised to D.<br></br>
                                    If  these women experience recurrent bleeds they should receive 250 i.u. anti-D at a minimum of 6 weekly intervals.
                                    <br></br><br></br>
                                    After 20 weeks gestation:<br></br>
                                    The volume of foetal-maternal haemorrhage (FMH) must be determined by acid elution (kleihaur). If the volume is greater than 4ml, this must be confirmed by flow cytometry. At least 500 i.u of anti-D should be administered intramuscularly and more should be given if the FMH is known to be greater than 4ml to D negative and non-sensitised women.
                                    If these women experience recurrent bleeds anti-D 500 i.u should be given at a minimum of 6 weekly intervals. FMH should be estimated every 2 weeks. If the 2 weekly FMH is positive, a minimum of 500 i.u should be given (more if FMH is greater than 4 ml) regardless of the presence or absence of passive anti-D and FMH should be reevaluated after 72 hours.
                                    <br></br><br></br>
                                    Following birth:<br></br>
                                    Cord blood, or a neonatal heel stick sample should be analysed for ABO and D type of the neonate.  Maternal samples for confirmatory ABO and D type and FMH should be collected after 30-45 minutes of the FMH to allow the foetal blood to disperse adequately in the maternal circulation. At least 500 i.u should be administered to the unsensitised D- negative mother of the D positive neonate known to have a maternal-foetal haemorrhage of less than 4ml. Additional 125 i.u. of anti-D immune globulin should be administered for each additional ml of FMH. In cases of FMH greater than 80 ml, intravenous anti-D administration should be considered.
                                    <br></br><br></br>
                                    Routine anti-D immunoglobulin administration of 500 i.u.intramuscularly should be administered at 28 and 34 weeks of pregnancy to D-negative and non- sensitised women. Alternatively 1500 i.u of anti-D may be given as a single dose at 28 weeks. Previous administration of anti-D should not affect routine antepartum or post partum prophylaxis(British Committee for Standards in Haematology, 2008).

                                    Syphilis in HIV+ pregnant women
                                    <br></br><br></br>
                                    •	All pregnant women should be screened for syphilis when pregnancy is confirmed either by RPR test or a treponemal screening test with a confirmatory non-treponemal test with titres; consider a second screen at 28-32 weeks of gestation. <br></br>
                                    •	Those treated for syphilis should be screened again twice during the third trimester- ideally at 28-32 weeks and at birth as the potential for treatment failure exists <br></br>
                                    •	If syphilis is diagnosed in the second half of pregnancy the foetus should be evaluated for foetal and or placental syphilis sonographically<br></br>
                                    •	Songraphic signs of syphilis include: thickened placenta, hepatomegaly, ascites, hydrops and foetal anaemia <br></br>
                                    •	Sonographic signs of foetal or placental syphilis can indicate a higher incidence of treatment failure <br></br>
                                    •	Placental syphilis infection increases the likelihood of vertical transmission of HIV <br></br>
                                    •	Parenteral Penicillin G is the only efficacious treatment during pregnancy<br></br>
                                    •	Parenteral Penicillin G treatment is effective at preventing in utero transmission and for treating foetal syphillis<br></br>
                                    •	Penicillin allergic pregnant women must be desensitised to penicillin and then treated with parenteral Penicillin G.<br></br>
                                    •	Treatment in the second half of pregnancy can be associated with the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction that can precipitate preterm labour and foetal distress; women with fever, decreased foetal movement or preterm contractions after treatment should seek attention.<br></br>
                                    •	No specific recommendations exist for HIV+ pregnant women and evidence is insufficient to recommend an optimal regimen.

                                    Secondary to concerns about efficacy during pregnancy, a second injection should be considered in HIV+ pregnant women (AIDSinfo, 2013)

                                    •	High HBV DNA levels are associated with perinatal transmission and passive-active immunoprophylaxis failure though perinatal transmission has been documented at undetectable HBV DNA levels as well(AIDSinfo, 2013).<br></br>
                                    •	Women with HBV infection should be screened for hepatitis A virus as they are at increased risk from complications from hepatitis co-infection. Non-immune women should be vaccinated (Panel on Treatment of HIV Infected Pregnant Women and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission, 2014).<br></br>
                                    •	Asymptomatic-acute infection in pregnancy should receive supportive therapy(AIDSinfo, 2013).<br></br>
                                    •	Pregnant women with HIV/Hepatitis B co-infection should be given ART with anti Hepatitis B activity.<br></br>

                                    •	Hepatitis C treatments, Interferon and Ribavarin are CONTRAINDICATED in pregnancy(AIDSinfo, 2013).<br></br>
                                    •	ARV considerations for HCV infected women are the same as for pregnant HIV infected women without HCV co-infection(AIDSinfo, 2013)<br></br>
                                    •	HIV/HCV co-infection risks liver toxicity in women on ARVs. Monitoring should be performed 1 month after initiation of ARVs and every 3 months thereafter.<br></br>
                                    •	HCV/HIV co-infection should be managed by a specialist.<br></br>
                                    •	Hepatitis C infection should be evaluated at 3 months post partum to allow pregnancy related changes to resolve.<br></br>
                                    •	Caesarean delivery DOES NOT reduce rates of perinatal transmission of Hepatitis C (AIDSinfo, 2013).<br></br>
                                    •	Infants born to women with HCV should be evaluated with anti- HCV antibody testing after 18months of age with confirmatory viral load testing. If testing is required prior to 18 months then two negative tests are required after two months with one being at or after 12 months as viremia is intermittent (Panel on Treatment of HIV Infected Pregnant Women and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission, 2014)

                                    Monitoring response to ART and drug resistance testing<br></br><br></br>

                                    •	Viral load monitoring is the preferred approach to diagnose treatment success or failure.<br></br>
                                    •	Viral load should be tested early after ART initiation (within 6 months) and repeated every 12 months in the non-pregnant adult population (World Health Organization, 2013).<br></br>
                                    •	Viral load reduction is generally seen 12-24 weeks after ART initiation in pregnant women (AIDSinfo, 2013c).<br></br>
                                    •	Treatment failure is defined as viral load persistently above 1000copies/ml over a 6 month period (two consecutive measurements three months apart).<br></br>
                                    •	If viral load monitoring is unavailable, CD4 count and clinical monitoring may be used to detect treatment failure with targeted viral load monitoring if available (World Health Organization, 2013).<br></br>
                                    •	Adequate response to therapy is an increase in CD4 count 50-150 cells/mm^3 per year with an accelerated response in the first three months (AIDSinfo, 2013a).<br></br>
                                    •	Drug resistance testing is recommended for all HIV infected individuals at entry into care, including for pregnant women.<br></br>
                                    •	 Genotypic testing is preferred in ART- naïve patients. <br></br>
                                    •	Drug resistance testing should be used to guide in the selection of drugs in cases of virologic failure and with suboptimal virologic response. With HIV RNA levels between 500-1000 copies/ml, resistance testing may be unsuccessful but should still be considered. <br></br>
                                    •	Phenotypic testing should be done in conjunction with genotypic testing with known or complex resistance profiles, particularly to PIs. <br></br>
                                    •	In addition to drug resistance testing at entry to care, pregnant women with detectible HIV RNA on ART should have drug resistance testing performed(AIDSinfo, 2013b). <br></br>
                                    •	Perinatal transmission of resistant strains of virus is unusual, though has been reported (Panel on Treatment of HIV Infected Pregnant Women and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission, 2014) <br></br>
                                    •	Women experiencing failure of virologic suppression during pregnancy (persistent viral load > 20-75 copies/ml) need to be evaluated for adherence, tolerability issues, dosage correctness and absorption issues (such as nausea and vomiting or lack of food). They should be evaluated for resistant virus and managed in consultation with an HIV specialist. ARV regimen change should be considered (Panel on Treatment of HIV Infected Pregnant Women and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission, 2014).<br></br>
                                    •	An automated HIV-2 resistance analysis tool is available freely online at http://www.hiv-grade.de (Panel on Treatment of HIV Infected Pregnant Women and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission, 2014).

                                        Group B Beta Haemolytic Strep (GBS) <br></br>
                                        Adapted from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention 2010 Guidelines for the Prevention of Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease

                                        Group B streptococcus is a leading cause of infectious early neonatal morbidity and mortality. Identification of GBS colonised women and the use of antibiotics as prophylaxis during labour has reduced the incidence of neonatal group B streptococcus disease.
                                        <br></br><br></br>
                                        GBS screening by lower vaginal and rectal swabs is recommended from 5 weeks before delivery- negative predictive value decreases with cultures greater  than 5 weeks before delivery
                                        <br></br><br></br>
                                        Women who are penicillin allergic with a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, respiratory distress and/or urticaria after receiving penicillin or a cephalosporin should have antibiotic susceptibility testing performed on GBS isolates.
                                        <br></br><br></br>
                                        - GBS prophylaxis is recommended if:
                                        <br></br>
                                        - GBS screening is positive late in pregnancy <br></br>
                                        - GBS bacteriuria is present at any time during pregnancy <br></br>
                                        - Previous infant with invasive GBS disease <br></br>
                                        - Unknown GBS status at onset of labour and, delivery at less than 37 weeks gestation, rupture of membranes 18 hours or greater, temperature at or above 38 degrees Celcius.

                                        Preferred therapy: Penicillin G, 5 million units IV initial dose, then 2.5-3.0 million units every 4 hours until delivery
                                        Or
                                        Ampicillin, 2g IV initial dose, then 1g IV every 8 hours until delivery
                                        <br></br>
                                        <br></br>
                                        If the woman is penicillin allergic without a history of the following after receiving penicillin or a cephalosporin- anaphylaxis, angioedema, respiratory distress and/or urticaria then she may have:
                                        <br></br>
                                        Cefazolin 2g IV initial dose, then 1gIV every 8 hours until delivery
                                        <br></br>
                                        If the woman is penicillin allergic with history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, respiratory distress and/or urticaria and if the isolate is susceptible to clindamycin and erythromycin she may be prophylaxed with:
                                        <br></br>
                                        Clindamycin, 900mg IV every 8 hours until delivery
                                        <br></br>
                                        If the isolate is not susceptible to clindamycin and erythromycin she may be prophylaxed with:
                                        <br></br>
                                        Vancomycin, 1g IV every 12 hours until delivery (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010a)

                                        •	Consider in women from countries or women whose partners are from countries where HIV-2 is endemic and who are ELISA HIV antibody positive but have consistently indeterminate western blot testing and HIV-1 viral loads at or below detectable limits.<br></br>
                                        •	HIV-2 is endemic in many West African countries including Ivory Coast, Ghana, Cape Verde, Gambia, Mali, Senegal, Liberia, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Mauritania, Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau, Niger, Sao Tome, and Togo; Angola; Mozambique; parts of India and France and Portugal.<br></br>
                                        •	HIV -2 has a 5- fold lower rate of sexual transmission and a 20-30 fold lower rate of perinatal transmission. Without intervention perinatal transmission rates are between 0-4%.<br></br>
                                        •	Two NRTIs and a boosted PI is recommended for pregnant women who require treatment for their own health with the preferred treatment being Lopinavir/ritonavir plus zidovudine/lamivudine or abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir/emtricitabine.<br></br>
                                        •	Optimal regimens have not been determined for pregnant women who do not require treatment for their own health though the following approached have been recommended: a boosted PI- based regimen (dual NRTI plus ritonavir boosted lopinavir) with the drugs stopped post partum or zidovudine prophylaxis alone during pregnancy and birth.<br></br>
                                        •	NNRTIs and enfuvirtide have no activity against HIV-2 and should not be used for either treatment or prophylaxis.<br></br>
                                        •	In cases of HIV-1 and HIV-2 co-infection a regimen should be chosen according to HIV-1 monoinfection guidelines but ensuring that the regimen also has activity against HIV-2.<br></br>
                                        •	Infants born to HIV-2 + mothers should receive the 6 week zidovudine prophylactic regimen (see intrapartum management guidelines)(Panel on Treatment of HIV Infected Pregnant Women and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission, 2014).<br></br>
